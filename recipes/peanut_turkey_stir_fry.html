            </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>For the rice</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook enough rice to yield 6.5 cups of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry rice will make 2-3 cups of cooked rice depending on what kind of rice you use. I used 150g of calrose rice here.</li>
                <li>Once the the rice is cooked, fluff it up and add in some lime juice and salt to flavor to your preference.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>For the roasted poblano sauce</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 425℉.</li>
                <li>Wash your peppers and cilantro. Remove the seed capsule from your peppers and roughly chop them into big pieces.</li>
                <li>Cut your onion into a large dice and remove the skin from the garlic.</li>
                <li>Place the onion, peppers, and garlic on a sheet pan. Drizzle over 2.6 tbsp of oil and salt to your preference. I find placing the peppers with the skin side facing up can help with the roasting process.</li>
                <li>Place the tray into the oven on the top shelf and roast for 15-18 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once roasted and the peppers have begun to blister, remove from the oven and rest for a few minutes. If you wish, you can peel away the skin from the exterior of the peppers. The roasting process should have loosened it. My rule for this is if it is easy to take off, I do it. If it takes a bit of effort to remove, I don't worry about it.</li>
                <li>Place the roasted vegetables, cilantro, yogurt, and lime juice into a blender. Blend until smooth and taste test. Adjust flavor with salt to taste. You can also add a bit of water to thin out your sauce if needed.</li>
                <li>Divide the sauce out into small ramekins to place into each container.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>For the roasted vegetables</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and cut your sweet potatoes and broccoli. Cut the potatoes into a large dice and the broccoli into small florets.</li>
                <li>Add the potatoes to a large bowl and 2.6 tbsp of oil with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Toss to coat.</li>
                <li>Spread the potatoes out on a sheet pan and roast at 425℉ for 22-25 minutes, turning half way through.</li>
                <li>Toss the broccoli with 1.3 tbsp of oil and salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>After the potatoes have been roasting for 10-12 minutes, remove them from the oven, toss around to flip. Move them to one side of the sheet pan and add the broccoli to the opposite site. Return to the oven for another 10-12 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>For the chicken</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add in 2.6 tbsp of oil and the ground chicken. Spread the chicken out over the bottom of the skillet and allow it to sit over the heat before breaking it up to develop good color.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to your preference and 5.2 tsp each of garlic powder and dried oregano.</li>
                <li>Break the chicken up into small pieces and stir. Once it has finished cooking and is no longer pink in color, taste test and adjust as needed.</li>
            </ol>
    <h2>Serving</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>This recipe makes 13 servings. Divide all of your ingredients between each of the 13 containers. Each one gets one ramekin of the roasted poblano sauce.</li>
            <li>After reheating each meal in the microwave, I like to top the meals with 1 tbsp of roasted pumpkin seeds and crumbled feta cheese. This is optional but can be a nice addition for texture and flavor.</li>
        </ol>
